# GoTiny Discord Bot

The GoTiny Discord Bot is an example of easy integration with GoTiny through the [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/robvanbakel/gotiny-sdk). After adding the Bot to a Discord server, it will sit in the background and listen for messages in all channels that contain links longer than 24 characters. The link is sent to the [GoTiny API](https://github.com/robvanbakel/gotiny-api) and immediately returned as a short link by the Bot in the same channel.

#### Built With

- [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org)
- [GoTiny](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gotiny)

Creating short links with GoTiny is accessible for everyone at [gotiny.cc](https://gotiny.cc) and for developers there's an [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/robvanbakel/gotiny-sdk) which is free and doesn't require authentication.
